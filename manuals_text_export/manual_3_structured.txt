# Camera MagicLink COLOR Instruction Manual

## Hardware Installation

1. Attach the mounting base to the wall or similar where you want to install the camera. Make sure that the mounting location has sufficient strength to support the camera with its bracket.
2. Mount the camera on the bracket and tighten the knob firmly.
3. Rotate the camera with the bracket onto the stand.
4. Connect the included 12V power supply.
5. After loosening the knob, you can align the camera. Then tighten the knob again.

## Usage

1. Connect the Cinch/Scart cable with its Cinch connectors to the corresponding sockets of the receiver. Make sure that the connector color and the color of the sockets match. Plug the Scart connector into the Scart socket of your TV set. Since the camera sends in "Mono", you should only connect the white connector.
2. Turn on the camera and receiver. Turn on your TV set and select the AV socket to which you have connected the receiver. The camera image should now appear on the screen.
3. If your TV set does not have a Scart socket, please connect the modulator output of the receiver and the antenna input of the TV set with a coaxial cable. Turn on the receiver and the camera. Now search on your TV set for the output channel of the receiver until the camera image appears.

*Note:* Important note on channel selection: Select the channel with the best possible transmission quality from the four available transmission channels. Make sure that the camera and the receiver are always set to the same transmission channel.
